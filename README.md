# Student_management_system

Project Description

The Student Management System is a web-based CRUD application developed using Spring Boot that allows users to manage student records efficiently. The system provides functionalities to add, view, update, delete, and search students based on their name.

The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot REST APIs, following a layered architecture consisting of Controller, Service, and Repository layers. Spring Data JPA with Hibernate is used for database interaction, which automatically handles SQL queries and object-relational mapping. An H2 in-memory database is used for data storage during runtime.

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs using the Fetch API. The user interface is designed to be modern, responsive, and user-friendly, featuring interactive buttons, hover effects, and real-time updates without page reloads.

The project demonstrates core concepts of Spring Boot, RESTful web services, CRUD operations, database integration, and frontend–backend communication, making it suitable for academic practical exams and beginner-level enterprise application development.
